    <abstract>
      <para>
    The Tisdale RST sampling site is operated by the California
    Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to obtain information on the
    temporal distribution, relative abundance, and composition of race
    and species of juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)
    and steelhead trout (O. mykiss) emigrating from the upper Sacramento
    River and tributaries to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta).
    The project collects data near the Tisdale Weir on the Sacramento
    River, using two paired rotary screw traps (RSTs) outfitted with two
    8-ft diameter cones.Â 
  </para>
      <para>
    The RST monitoring site at Tisdale Weir was established meet a
    requirement of the 2011 amendment to the reasonable and prudent
    alternative (RPA) of the 2009 biological and conference opinion (BO)
    on the long-term operations of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and
    State Water Project (SWP). The amendment required the Bureau of
    Reclamation (USBR) and the California Department of Water Resources
    (DWR) to fund a new juvenile salmonid monitoring site on the
    Sacramento River between Red Bluff Diversion Dam (RBDD) and Knights
    Landing. The purpose of the new site was to provide early warning of
    fish movement and determine survival of listed fish species leaving
    spawning habitat in the upper Sacramento River.
  </para>
      <para>
    CDFW issued ITP 2081-2019-066-00 to DWR on March 31, 2020, for the
    long-term operation of the SWP in the Delta. Condition 7.5.2 of the
    ITP requires the development and establishment of a spring-run
    Chinook salmon juvenile production estimate (JPE) to increase
    understanding regarding the impacts water operations have on the
    spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River
    watershed and inform the development of minimization measures to
    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage
    facilities. Data from the Tisdale RST will be used along with other
    datasets from juvenile salmonid monitoring programs in the
    Sacramento River Watershed to inform the development of JPE modeling
    approaches.
  </para>
      <para>
    Salmonid data collected from the Tisdale RST, among other datasets,
    is also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the
    movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River Watershed to
    estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that
    have entered the Delta. SaMT is a real-time operations monitoring
    team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP which meets
    weekly from October through June, to provide advice for real-time
    management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water Operation
    Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and spring-run
    Chinook salmon in the Delta.

            <title>Current Trap Location</title>
            <para>
      Traps are located less than 1 mile upstream of Tisdale Weir near
      RM 120 on the Sacramento River, approximately 15 miles south of
      Colusa, California.

            <title>Monitoring Schedule</title>
            <para>
      Traps are monitored October through June. They are continuously
      trapping except under high flows and unsafe working conditions.
      Traps are serviced daily within a 24-hour period, more if needed
      due to high debris amounts or fish catch.
    </para>

          <section>
            <title>Daily Environmental Data</title>
            <para>
      Daily environmental data collected is flow in cubic feet per
      second (recorded from the CDEC Gauging Station: Sacramento River
      at Colusa (COL)), water temperature (Fahrenheit/Celsius), river
      depth (inches/feet), turbidity (nephelometric turbidity units),
      dissolved oxygen (milligrams per liter), conductivity
      (microSiemens per centimeter), and velocity (meters per second).

            <title>Fish Measurements</title>
            <para>
      Fork length measurements are taken to the nearest millimeter. For
      chinook salmon, fork length measurements are taken for 50 randomly
      selected individuals per category: marked (with an adipose fin
      clip) spring-, fall-, winter- or late fall-runs; unmarked spring-,
      fall-, winter- or late fall-runs. Run designated by Length at Date
      criteria (Fisher 1992). For steelhead, measurements are taken for
      50 randomly selected per marked or unmarked. For non-salmonoid
      fish, measurements are taken for the first 10 indiviuals (total
      length measurements to the nearest mm).

            <title>Trap Efficiency Trials</title>
            <para>
      Juvenile fall-run captured in RSTs or obtained from Coleman
      National Fish Hatchery. Frequency of once per week from December
      to May across variable flow and environmental conditions as catch
      totals and/or hatchery availability allows. Mortality between the
      release point and the trap is assumed to be negligible. Release
      site approximately 1 mile upstream of the trapping site.

      Tag.
