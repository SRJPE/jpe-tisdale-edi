## Trap Equipment
Two in-line 8-foot rotary screw traps (RST).

## Current Trap Location
Traps are located less than 1 mile upstream of Tisdale Weir near RM 120 on the Sacramento River, approximately 15 miles south of Colusa, California. 

## Monitoring Schedule
Traps are monitored October through June. They are continuously trapping except under high flows and unsafe working conditions. Traps are serviced daily within a 24-hour period, more if needed due to high debris amounts or fish catch.

## Daily Environmental Data
Daily environmental data collected is flow in cubic feet per second (recorded from the CDEC Gauging Station: Sacramento River at Colusa (COL)), water temperature (Fahrenheit/Celsius), river depth (inches/feet), turbidity (nephelometric turbidity units), dissolved oxygen (milligrams per liter), conductivity (microSiemens per centimeter), and velocity (meters per second).

## Fish Measurements
Fork length measurements are taken to the nearest millimeter. For chinook salmon, fork length measurements are taken for 50 randomly selected individuals per category: marked (with an adipose fin clip) spring-, fall-, winter- or late fall-runs; unmarked spring-, fall-, winter- or late fall-runs. Run designated by Length at Date criteria (Fisher 1992). For steelhead, measurements are taken for 50 randomly selected per marked or unmarked. For non-salmonoid fish, measurements are taken for the first 10 indiviuals (total length measurements to the nearest mm). 

## Fish Counts
All fish not measured are plus counted by hand.

## Trap Efficiency Trials
Juvenile fall-run captured in RSTs or obtained from Coleman National Fish Hatchery. Frequency of once per week from December to May across variable flow and environmental conditions as catch totals and/or hatchery availability allows. Mortality between the release point and the trap is assumed to be negligible. Release site approximately 1 mile upstream of the trapping site. 

## Trap Efficiency Marks
Fish are marked with Bismarck Brown Y (BBY) whole body stain. Fish are alternatively marked with a Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE) Tag.
